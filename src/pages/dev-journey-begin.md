##Early Ambitions
The decision to beginning this coding journey started with my want to learn some technical skills in order to make myself more marketable and not have my skills become obsolete. During my undergradaute and graduate education I was very naive and thought that my soft-skills would be useful and that I would easily get a job in the government or non-profit sector. What I didn't understand fully was how badly the financial crisis in 2009 was going to hit me. Getting a job with a Master's degree, fluency in several languages, and a ton of intercultural experience from my time abroad wouldn't even get me a call back. I thought that all my education would open all these doors for me and that everything was going to be easy because most of my life things were very easy. Life just sort of worked out. What I didn't realize was that the real-world was not like my little dreamscape that just happened.

All my life I have been incredibily lucky and I'm sure I can chalk that up to a number of factors. However, at this point in my life I need to think about what kind of skills I want to have, what I want to build, and how I want to be remembered. I've learned that building things is the best way to leave a mark. I'm not looking for a big mark, but one that I can use to highlight my skills. More importantly, I need to show myself that I can do something, I can make something, and I'm not doing this through luck, but by a lot of hard work.

##Learning Process
Learning development has been one of the things in my life that has not come truly naturally. Everyday I run into mistakes, errors, or just general confusion that I have not encountered in some of my previous endeavors or educational pursuits. I'm not one that takes to these failures well. I get discouraged and upset. I like things to work out the first time. I try to plan ahead and make sure that I hvae laid out a plan and that I see it through. However, I have learned many times over that during development there are many things I have not planned for. I need to do some serious problem solving and getting upset will not make them go away. I've certainly progressed with honing other soft-skills that I took for granted and thought that I had a real good grasp on.

##Future Outlook
All in all, this development journey is something that I need to show myself that I can do. I can be more than someone who has deep educational roots in social sciences. I can do more complex things. I can create. I can develop different avenues to connect with others. Most of all, I'm doing something that I had long convinced myself that I couldn't do. Everyday, even when I receive countless responses from employers saying that they are moving forward with other candidates or that my skills don't match their position, I know that I'm now doing something that greatly improves my self-esteem and that I have learned skills that will get me ahead in life. It may not be this instant, but I will get better and I will learn more and more. I know that wherever I land and continue to grow will be the right place for me and know that there is a place out there that is willing to give me a chance.
